Q1) Write a one paragraph summary of the program in your own words.  What is being asked of you?  What will you implement in this assignment?

This project will be implementing a word guessing game using client-server communication through sockets. The server will host the game and give the client a random word along with the number of letter guesses allowed. The client's objective is to guess the word, letter by letter, before they have exhausted their limit of guesses. The server will respond to each guess by updating the correctly chosen characters and the number of guessing remaining.


Q2) What you anticipate being the most challenging aspect of the assignment?

We think game logic and getting the network setup properly will be the most challenging aspects since it's not something we've done before. Working with unsigned ints and having multiple clients connected to one server at once is also something that would fit into that category.


Q3) Give a list of at least three resources you plan to draw from if you get stuck on something.

Man Pages, previous C assignments, Slack, Professor Mare 


Q4) What is your plan for meeting to finish this program (e.g. ``every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 3pm-5pm until it's done.).

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday anytime after class. Also, just staying communicative of eachother's schedules.
